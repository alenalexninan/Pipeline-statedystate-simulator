Pipeline Steadystate engine
We have multiple simulation engines available for carrying out pipeline steady state calculation. I am Pallning to Leverage OLGA steady state engine for my current use. This could be used for developing cutom modules for implementing surveillance activities such as well Production optimization etc. The current code will be written in Python, since thats the only language I know. I plan to port it to C++ once I learn it.
